                                        THE ROADRUNNER MANUAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Roadrunner is the essential library for PID-controlled movement. Implementation of the drive
    features is quite simple: declare an instance of the SampleMecanumDriveREV class AFTER
    initialization. There are three sets of parameters which could be used to declare the drive,
    allowing for drive encoder, two-wheel odometer, and three-wheel odometer measurement systems
    (localizers) respectively. Make sure the parameters are given in the correct order when giving
    odometer wheels.

    At the moment, trajectory coordinates of 0,0 are ALWAYS to be assigned to the center of the
    field and 0 heading to be facing away from the build plates. This is done by using the
    setPoseEstimate() method, which assigns the robot's current coordinate system and heading.

    The addMarker() method is placed inside the trajectory to force the robot to do other things
    while it drives. The main parameter that dictates what the robot does is written in the
    following way:

    () -> {<Method 1>; <Method 2>; ... return null;}

    Additional parameters such as time or position to be nearest to add extra control onto when
    the action is carried out. Otherwise, it just occurs between the two parts of the trajectory you
    put the addMarker() in between.

    Remember to use the update() method before each spline, so that doesn't freak the hell out, and
    don't create trajectories with sharp changes in velocity. You will break the wheels.
